# Next Up - A conversation timer app
Next Up is a timer app that can be used when having conversations or debates where you would like each person to have the same amount of time to speak.

## How to use
---
In Next Up there are 2 timers. The **Holding** timer and the **Passing** Timer.


1. Set the Holding timer to the desired time you would like each person to speak.


2. Set the Passing timer to the time you think is needed for a transition or quick pause to take place.
For example, if you were to pass around a physical stick you would set this timer to a time youd think is needed to do that.

3. Submit. A counter and a set of buttons to control the timer will be displayed. 

## Counter
---
A green counter means it is currently on the holding timer.
A red counter means it is the passing timer.

Each timer will count down from the given timer. Once the holding timer hits 0 a sound will be played and the passing timer will start counting down automatically.
